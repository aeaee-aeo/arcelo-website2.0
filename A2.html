      <p>2024 has been a rollercoaster ride filled with ups and downs, but in the end, I made it through. The year was a mix of school, friendships, challenges, and memorable moments that shaped my journey.</p>

      <p>Academically, it was another tough year as a Computer Engineering student. There were countless practices and performances, especially for PE-related events, which required late-night rehearsals. Despite the exhaustion, these experiences helped me grow and bond with my classmates. The school year had its share of stress, but finishing another semester felt like an accomplishment.</p>
      <p>As a dedicated Carat, I found joy in celebrating special days related to Seventeen, even if I could only watch their concerts through clips. Their content, including the Nana Tour, became my comfort during busy and stressful times. Music continued to be a big part of my life, keeping me motivated and entertained.</p>
      <p>In April, while still in the second semester, I enrolled in a TESDA course in Creative Web Design. It was a new learning experience that added to my skills, and despite my already busy schedule, I managed to balance both school and training. By May, I successfully completed the course and graduated from the program, marking another achievement for the year.</p>
      <p>One of the biggest highlights was my summer break. I finally had time to catch up on sleep, watch a lot of movies, and hang out with friends. Simple moments, like watching Inside Out 2, going swimming, and celebrating my birthday with my family, made the break even more special.</p>
      <p>The latter part of the year was mostly focused on school again, with a few events here and there. As the holidays approached, I enjoyed reconnecting with friends, exchanging gifts, and spending Christmas with my family. Despite facing some rough moments, I ended the year feeling grateful. Looking back, 2024 was a challenging yet meaningful year, and Iâ€™m thankful for all the lessons and memories it brought.</p>
