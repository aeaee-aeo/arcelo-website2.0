      <p>2024 was a year of growth, challenges, and deep reflection. It was a journey filled with moments of joy, accomplishment, and heartbreak—one that tested my strength in ways I never expected.</p>

      <p>Academically, it was another tough year as a Computer Engineering student. There were countless practices and performances, especially for PE-related events, which required late-night rehearsals. Despite the exhaustion, these experiences helped me grow and bond with my classmates. The school year had its share of stress, but finishing another semester felt like an accomplishment.</p>
      <p>As a dedicated Carat, I found joy in celebrating special days related to Seventeen, even if I could only watch their concerts through clips. Their content, including the Nana Tour, became my comfort during busy and stressful times. Music continued to be a big part of my life, keeping me motivated and entertained.</p>
      <p>In April, while still in the second semester, I enrolled in a TESDA course in Creative Web Design. It was a new learning experience that added to my skills, and despite my already busy schedule, I managed to balance both school and training. By May, I successfully completed the course and graduated from the program, marking another achievement for the year.</p>
      <p>The summer break was a much-needed pause from the hectic school life. I finally had time to rest, watch movies, and spend quality time with friends and family. Small joys, like watching Inside Out 2, going swimming, and celebrating my birthday, became treasured memories.</p>
      <p>But as the year went on, life took an unexpected and painful turn. In September, I lost my uncle. The grief was heavy, and our family struggled to navigate the pain of losing someone so dear. Then, in November, another heartbreaking loss came—I lost my other uncle. The weight of losing two family members in such a short time was overwhelming.</p>
      <p>Through these losses, I realized how unprepared we were—not just emotionally, but also in practical matters. Planning a funeral, handling arrangements, and making important decisions during such a difficult time was incredibly stressful. It made me understand that death is not only about mourning but also about responsibilities that no one talks about until they are forced to face them. The experience taught me that being prepared, no matter how uncomfortable it may seem, is something every family should consider. </p>
      <p>As the year came to a close, I tried to find solace in the holiday season. Christmas was bittersweet—it was a time of warmth and togetherness, but it also reminded me of those who were no longer with us. Despite the grief, I found comfort in the love of my family and the support of my friends.</p>
      <p>Looking back, 2024 was a year of profound lessons. It taught me resilience, the importance of treasuring moments, and the reality that life is unpredictable. Though the pain of loss remains, I am choosing to move forward with gratitude—for the memories, for the people who stood by me, and for the strength I found within myself.</p>
