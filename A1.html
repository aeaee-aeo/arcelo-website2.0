      <p>Hi! I'm Althea Lee B. Arcelo, a 20-year-old student from Cebu, Philippines. I'm currently in my third year pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at Cebu Technological University-Danao Campus. As a dedicated student, I'm always eager to expand my skills and knowledge in the ever-evolving field of technology. Problem-solving and innovation excite me, and I aspire to use my education to make meaningful contributions in engineering and technology.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Personal Interests</h2>
      <p>Beyond academics, I have a wide range of hobbies that bring balance and joy to my life. I love watching movies and series, especially K-dramas and Japanese shows. My favorite genres include fantasy, thriller, legal, and comedy—stories that keep me entertained and challenge my imagination. I enjoy diving into well-crafted narratives that keep me on the edge of my seat.</p>
      <p>I'm also a huge fan of Seventeen and BTS! Watching their shows like <i>Going Seventeen</i> and <i>Run BTS</i> is one of my favorite pastimes. Their music and content never fail to inspire and uplift me. Music, in general, plays an essential role in my life—whether it’s to boost my mood, help me relax, or motivate me while studying.</p>
      <p>Despite my passion for technology and entertainment, my aspirations are simple yet meaningful. My ultimate goal is to lead a happy and fulfilling life. I cherish the little moments—whether it's watching a great drama, listening to my favorite songs, or spending time with loved ones.</p>
      <p>With my determination, love for learning, and vibrant personality, I'm excited to embrace every step of my journey, both as a future engineer and as someone who finds happiness in life's simple joys.</p>
